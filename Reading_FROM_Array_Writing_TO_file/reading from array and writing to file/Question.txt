Exercise: reading from more than one Array and writing to one file:

Store 10 firstnames, lastnames and ages(int) in 3 arrays. 
Use the first two array element contents to populate elements in a fourth array called nameLengths. Check its content using sout.
Write the contents of the four arrays into a textfile. Each line should have the format: lastName ", " firstName "\t" age "\t" nameLength.
Check textfile when finished. 
See "WEEK BEGINNING 230123" resources on writing to a file.

Stretch Yourself!

Suppose you have a textfile with records formatted the same way as the records written into the file in the previous question.
Suppose you were getting more data from the user via keyboard and storing them into a relevant set of arrays.
How might you write both sets of records into a new file, so that the records are sorted by firstname?
(Assume all firstnames are unique).
